    While creating this blog and the libraries and tools behind the scenes takes a lot of time, I really enjoy it and I'm committed to keep working on it. By supporting me, you allow me to invest more time into new content, new features, and continuous maintainance.

    The best way to support me is to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/phil-opp"><em>sponsor me on GitHub</em></a>. GitHub will even match sponsorships until October 2020! If you prefer other platforms, I also have <a href="https://www.patreon.com/phil_opp"><em>Patreon</em></a> and <a href="https://donorbox.org/phil-opp"><em>Donorbox</em></a> accounts. The latter is the most flexible as it supports multiple currencies and one-time contributions.

    Thank you!
